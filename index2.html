        How I got here
        </h2>
        <p style="font-family: helvetica neue"> This is my first year at MNSU, however, it is my third year of college. I am a transfer student from MSU-Moorhead, where I did two years in the graphic design program. Unfortunately, they decided to make major changes and cuts within the program, which caused me to make the tough choice to move to Mankato. I moved here in August and quickly fell in love with the campus, my professors, and the town which reinforced my choice all the more. I am so happy here and so many fabulous doors have been opened as a result of other doors closing behind me.    </p>

        Future plans</h2> 
        <p style="font-family: helvetica neue">
        As far as school goes, I plan to graduate next spring with my BFA in Graphic Design and a concentration in Printmaking (which has absolutely captured my heart!). Where I’ll end up after that? Who knows! Something I love about the design world is that it is ever-changing and so versatile. I have many things I would like to do in life and I feel as though I just might do all of them. <b>However, if I had to choose a dream career path, it would be tattooing.</b> It is something that captivates me. I love getting them, looking at them, and creating for others, so I think it is a job I would love and never be bored of. I have high hopes of finding an apprenticeship one day, probably after I graduate and have a little more time! Below are some photos of my tattoos, I currently have 5. I have a lupine (MN wildflower), a hot air balloon that matches with my mom, a monarch butterfly that was from a painting that my grandma did, a stick and poke moth + matchstick that I did myself, and most recently, a half sleeve of peonies! I love them all and I absolutely have plans for more! </p>

        <p style="font-family: helvetica neue">I would also love to write and illustrate a children’s book at some point. That has always been a goal of mine for many years now. I think that the perfect opportunities will come together just as they’re supposed to, that’s how it always seems to work out for me! If I had to pick a more easily accessible job in the design field, I think I would love working for a brewery or creative magazine. :-)
